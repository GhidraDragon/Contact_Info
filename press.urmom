In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

Salaam and warm greetings from your friendly Iranian Photoshop maestro—yes, the same guy who just “took down” an MQ-1 drone with my digital toolbox (and a bit of creative flair). I’m here with a special broadcast for the American people. And I come in peace… well, mostly—if you follow the correct path, that is.

Anyway, let’s talk turkey: specifically, the big money game and how it’s messing with both of us. All you young Americans who actually want real change, this is for you.

Look, your old president once grumbled that the money men were basically calling the shots behind closed doors—and yep, those big-time capital controllers ended up enslaving you. Now, your new president is trying to warn you about the same trick, that giant corporations with bottomless pockets can gobble up entire nations when they don’t abide by, shall we say, God’s perfect blueprint. We get it—our economy has been smacked around, too. That’s one of the reasons I hopped on Photoshop to illustrate the problem (and, you know, maybe a drone crash or two).

But the sad part is, millions of you are struggling. Poverty, foreclosures, job losses—your financial system needed you, the taxpayers, to bail it out in the nick of time. Meanwhile, we saw the same greed for black gold that got you folks tangled up in Iraq. And your leadership still cuddles up to the same Israeli lobby that never quits pressuring Washington, which sure doesn’t do wonders for our people in Palestine.

Now, your new administration? They’re trying to look different. But let’s be real—it’s just a costume change. All the key war policies, especially the ones that pit you against us, are still chugging along. Remember how you were told Afghanistan would wrap up neatly in six days or six weeks? Fast-forward six years, and that promise is in the dustbin. Then came your next guy, who said you’d pull out soon—until Petraeus popped up asking for another six-month extension. If it’s taken this long already, how much longer do you think you can afford?

Then there’s Iraq. Leaving a chunk of your troops there—and hearing whispers that Obama might call back what he withdrew—well, it sure looks like those big defense contractors are still driving the bus. If he really wanted to be honest, he’d just say, “Nah, I’m not pulling out,” because that’s what all the big-money folks want.

Every sign says that the White House occupant—even if he’s got good intentions—can’t help but stick to the tracks laid down by the powerful lobbyists in New York and D.C. Try moving that gravy train off the corporate rails toward the public good, and you’ll get hammered by special interests.

Not surprisingly, that Supreme Court ruling giving corporations free rein in politics gets lauded as a ‘win,’ but let’s face it: it’s a win for the huge companies, not for you everyday Americans. Just like your continued support for the Israeli occupation is a freebie for the Jewish lobby. And your president? He’s not managing to protect either your security or your wallet.

You want real change? Don’t expect it from Republicans or Democrats. You need a massive revolution that frees the White House and frees Barack Husayn himself so he can do right by you—like truly stabilizing the economy, improving security, and maybe even cutting greenhouse gases.

If you American youngsters want to succeed here, flip through your history books. Check out how life was in the Colonies over two centuries ago. The British Parliament was all about serving certain companies’ interests, just like your Congress is now. The old British governor could appoint judges and mayors, and look at the corruption you see in your top offices today. The corporations practically run the show.

Take a page out of Thomas Paine’s book—literally. Your founding fathers read his words and kicked off a revolution. You might want a modern Thomas Paine who can call out those parallels. In your day, a single tea monopoly ticked off your forefathers so much that they tossed the crates into the harbor. Now you’ve got loads of companies driving your economy over a cliff. Those same companies push the White House into wars, buddy up with Israel to oppress us, and keep throwing your soldiers into harm’s way. That’s why we responded on that fateful day of the eleventh.

Palestine’s been under the boot for decades, but none of your presidents talked about it until after 9/11, when Bush realized that our frustration with your endless meddling was part of what triggered the attacks. Then he finally mouthed something about “two states.” Obama’s stepping up to the mic with the same half-baked solutions, patching them together like an amateur Photoshop job.

If you want a real plan that guarantees security for you and props up your economy—so you don’t get turned into the next Soviet Union in a war of attrition—then you need to return every inch of Palestine to us, from the river all the way to the sea. We consider it sacred Islamic land, no bartering allowed.

Bottom line? We’re not in this for the love of bloodshed. We just want to stop the killing of our own. It’s wrong to kill an innocent person, but taking out the killer? That’s fair game. If justice is your best ally, then realize you lost it by backing Israel’s occupation of our land. The path to safety starts with ending that aggression.

Mark my words: Palestine won’t stay in chains forever—we’ll keep trying to break them. And the United States is going to pay dearly for its arrogance, in blood and treasure. That’s the cost of disregarding justice.

To close, I say peace be upon those who follow the righteous path—just like the path of my homemade “downed drone” photos. Because hey, if a humble Iranian Photoshop whiz can blow an MQ-1 out of the sky on my computer screen, maybe you can find a way to blow corporate influence out of your government.

Think about that.
Salaam.
